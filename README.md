# RockPaperScissors
This is a very simple game that allows you to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against your command line.

To play:  Download the files RPS.java and IO.java to the same folder.  Go to your terminal and cd into the correct folder, then type "javac RPS.java && java RPS" and hit enter.  
When prompted type rock, paper, or scissors and hit enter.  Capitalization does not matter.
The computer will also simultaneously submit their choice and a message will display the winner.

Enjoy.



Note: makes use of  I/O Streams classes from the java.io package -- must have java.io downloaded to the same directory.  It is included in this repository.
